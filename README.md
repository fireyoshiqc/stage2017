# Stage 2017

This repo will serve to host various projects that could be useful for developing research contributions.

## Active projects
### Félix
#### TestOverlay
A tentative AXI4 Full+Lite peripheral to communicate from the PS to the PL using the Pynq board.
Currently works with a combinatorial module, but not with a synchronous module (work in progress).
### Gabriel

### Mehdi
## Completed projects
### Félix
#### LFSR RNG
A module that generates random 8-bit numbers using 32-bit LFSRs (Linear Feedback Shift Registers). The generated numbers can be capped to a maximum using an 8-bit input port.
This design is optimized for minimal area. It can safely operate at 300 MHz (target frequency), up to 440 MHz (after that, negative slack begins to appear).
